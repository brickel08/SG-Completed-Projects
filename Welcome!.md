# SG-Completed-Projects
A collection of completed projects from my time at the Software Guild.

Welcome to my public repo of completed Software Guild projects! I attended Software Guild fully remote from July 2020 - July 2021. During my time there, I focused on learning Java primarily, but was also introduced to many different languages. I used SQL, JDBC, JSON, AJAX, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, XML, Spring Boot, etc. to complete these projects.
